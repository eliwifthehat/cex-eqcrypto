# CSP Fix Summary

## 🚨 Problem
Your app was blocking Supabase connections due to overly restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) settings.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Development Mode CSP Disabled**
- CSP is now **disabled in development mode** for easier debugging
- CSP is **enabled in production mode** for security
- This allows Supabase to work properly during development

### 2. **Production CSP Configuration**
When you deploy to production, the CSP will include:
```javascript
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
    fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
    imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'", "https://replit.com"],
    connectSrc: [
      "'self'", 
      "wss:", 
      "ws:", 
      "https://api.coingecko.com", 
      "https://api.moralis.io",
      "https://*.supabase.co",
      "https://supabase.co",
      "https://replit.com",
      "https://heldzockilbftitlcbac.supabase.co",
      "https://fstream.binance.com",
      "https://api.binance.com"
    ],
    frameSrc: ["'self'"],
    objectSrc: ["'none'"],
    upgradeInsecureRequests: [],
  },
}
```

## 🔧 How to Test

### **Option 1: Use the Restart Script**
```bash
./restart-dev.sh
```

### **Option 2: Manual Restart**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then run:
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### **Option 3: Production Test**
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## 🎯 What Should Work Now

- ✅ **Supabase authentication** (no more CSP errors)
- ✅ **Real-time price feeds** (CoinGecko, Binance)
- ✅ **WebSocket connections** for order updates
- ✅ **External API calls** for crypto data
- ✅ **Development environment** (Replit)

## 🚀 For Production Deployment

The CSP configuration is ready for:
- ✅ **Railway deployment**
- ✅ **Custom domains** (like `cex.eqadvertise.com`)
- ✅ **All external APIs**
- ✅ **WebSocket connections**

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**: Restart your development server
2. **Verify Supabase works**: Try logging in/out
3. **Check price feeds**: Verify real-time data loads
4. **Deploy to Railway**: When ready for production

## 🔍 If Issues Persist

### **Check Browser Console**
Look for any remaining CSP errors and note the blocked URLs.

### **Clear Browser Cache**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Clear browser cache completely

### **Check Environment Variables**
Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Supabase credentials:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://heldzockilbftitlcbac.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

**The CSP issues should now be resolved!** Try restarting your development server and testing the Supabase authentication.
